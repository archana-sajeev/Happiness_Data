This repository contains annual data from the **World Happiness Report** dataset (sourced from Kaggle), offering insights into global happiness by country using survey results and key indicators.Focuse on how different factors influence happiness scores across countries and time.  Using **Power Query** for data prep and **Power BI** for visual analysis, we explore global well-being, regional trends, and key drivers of happiness.

## 📊 Features
- Country-wise happiness scores and rankings, based on Gallup World Poll survey responses.  
- Economic, social, and health factors influencing well-being.  
- Data from **2015 onwards**, enabling time-series and cross-country analysis.  

## 📂 Example Columns
- **Country**
